This project demonstrates how to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images using EasyOCR and OpenCV. The system detects text regions in an image, draws bounding boxes around them, and overlays the recognized text on the image.

🚀 Features

Load and process images with OpenCV.

Extract text from images using EasyOCR.

Draw bounding boxes and labels around detected text.

Visualize results with Matplotlib.

Customizable confidence threshold for filtering weak detections.
